Created an entire ETL process in a database and a Power bI dashboard to utilize the customer data and achieve below goals:
1. Analyze Customer Data at below levels
  * a. Demographic
  * b. Geographic
  * c. Payment & Account Info
  * d. Services
2. Study Churner Profile & Identify Areas for Implementing Marketing Campaigns
3. Identify a Method to Predict Future Churners


In this complete CHURN ANALYSIS project using SQL Server, Power BI & Python, we will cover a wide range of topics which includes
1. ETL process in SQL Server
2. Data Cleaning in SQL Server
3. Power BI Transformations
4. Power BI Visualization & Enhancing Visuals
5. Build Machine Learning Model - Random Forest in Jupyter Notebook
6. Visualize Predicted Data in Power BI - Predicted Churner Profile
   

I worked on building a churn prediction solution for a telecom business, focusing on spotting customers who might leave. By exploring patterns in their usage, plans, and account history, I was able to highlight the main reasons behind churn. I cleaned and prepared the data, created meaningful features, and trained a machine learning model that gave reliable predictions. Visual insights made it easy to explain the trends and risk factors to decision-makers. The outcome was a set of clear, practical steps the business could take to keep more customers and strengthen loyalty.
